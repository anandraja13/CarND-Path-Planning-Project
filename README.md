# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
This is the project submission for the highway path planning project for the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.


# Incremental Progress
* Set up repo, get the stationary car in the scene.
* Get the car to move in a straight line.
* Add a TrajectoryPlanner class to handle the planning.
* Get the car to follow the middle lane.
* Get the car to slow down to a pre-determined velocity when there's a car in front.
* Make the car obey acceleration/deceleration limits.
* Make the car change lanes using some rudimentary logic - however, jerk and accel limits are violated at turns.
* Obey acceleration and jerk limits - but drives very conservatively.
